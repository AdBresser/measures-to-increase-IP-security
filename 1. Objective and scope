1. Objective and scope

The objective of this document is to create insight in the measures taken to increase the security and stability of the Internet routing system. There is already a lot of information created and organized (like [MANRS]) around this subject. In this document it is structured in an accessible way and some architectural and business operations measures are added.
The focus is on possible measures in the IP and BGP routing domain. There is no guarantee that this overview is complete. It doesnâ€™t take into account the number of deployments and is most certainly not a risk assessment.
